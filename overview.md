# Applied Learning through Iterative Memorization/Brute-force

Or the ALIMB method (pronounced A-LIMB)

## Stage 1)
Blindly follow along with a tutorial until things start to make more sense.

This is the first half of the brute force part of the ALIMB method. You are just going to bash your head against a tutorial until something cracks.

At the end of each day delete your progress in the tutorial, and force yourself to start the tutorial from scratch the next day. This is the iterative part of the ALIMB method.

## Stage 2)
Begin writing your own tutorial based off the tutorial from stage 1, giving yourself as English level description as possible of what you're trying to accomplish / memorize.

You can give yourself hints on sticky parts that aren't directly the things you're trying to memorize.

In the same manner as stage 1, you are going to delete your progress following your own tutorial at the end of each day, forcing yourself to start following your tutorial at the very begginging the next day.

If needed you can view the tutorial from stage 1, anything you needed to look up in the original tutorial should be augmented in your tutorial so next time you don't need to look at the original tutorial.

## Stage 3)
Once you've gone through stage 2 enough days over enough days, eventually you won't need to go to the original tutorial, and will just be able to follow your tutorial for getting the result the original tutorial gave. Once you reach this point, start trying to get as far as possible from your memory, and only check on your own tutorial once you get stuck.

## Stage 4)
Usually by the time you've written a clear enough tutorial to follow along with, you've basically memorized everything you've set out to learn. 

But now in the future you can follow your own tutorial to very quickly get back up to speed with what you've memorized over a few days. It is highly recommended you go through your own tutorial on a monthly-ish basis to commit what you've learned/memorized to long term memory, as well as helping you see anything else that can be used to improve your tutorial.



Congratulations you've just iteratively applied brute-force memorization to learn an applied topic
